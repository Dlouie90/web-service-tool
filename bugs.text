This is a list of all the known bugs.


1.
    Problem:
        Going into composition view of a Node and creating a new Node inside
        the composition then backtracking one level and THEN returning back to
        the same composition view. The newly created node is missing. It is
        stored in the data structure because if you reload the graph, all the
        nodes are there.

    Temporarily solution:
       Save the graph and load it again. The missing node will reappear.
